## Analysis of tumor grade, tumor size, and histologic type in ER positive and triple negative breast cancers

## Project organization
This project uses data from the article cited below to make comparisons and correlations between tumor grade, tumor size, and histologic type for ER positive
and triple negative tumor samples.


## Data
The citation for the article that has the data this project used is below.

## Data folder

Contained in the data folder are the raw data file named tumor location raw data_final, the tidy raw data file named Tidy data for raw file,
the csv files for the tidy data for subtypes of each cancer. 

## About the analysis
The raw data that was provided was tidy but some improvements had to be made. I tidied the raw data by changing the names of the columns
to ones that were clearer. I also made separate tidy data files for ER positive and triple negative samples. 

## Assumptions 
The information provided was straightforward and I made no assumptions about the data.

## Reproducibility
The files for my analysis include annotations for each step in the process. The questions I asked are provided with a rationale for asking the 
question. For someone with the level of knowledge equivale to what I gained from this class should be able to follow the code to reproduce this data.
